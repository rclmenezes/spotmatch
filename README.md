This project was created last year, in early 2012. It is built with jQuery, soundManager and Django. Strangely, this app was able to download songs off of Spotify onto the server, which their API somehow allows (though not purposefully, I think). Seriously, as in we could download the song as a .wav and convert it to a .mp3 or whatever. Not sure if Spotify has stopped this or not.

Anywho, while we could download any song off of Spotify, our server could only download one song at a time. That limitation basically crippled the project.

I haven't included the settings file, because I have some credentials in there, but I can add it without local settings later.

Made with Kelly Weeks, Jose Mena and Teo Georgiev.
