This project was done last year, in early 2012. This project used jQuery, soundManager and Django. It worked by essentially downloading the song off of Spotify, which the API somehow allows (though not purposefully, I think). Seriously, as in you can download the song and convert it to an .ogg or whatever. Not sure if Spotify has stopped that or not.

Anywho, while we could download any song off of Spotify, the limitation here was that Spotify only allowed our server to download one song at a time. That basically crippled the project.

I haven't included the settings_file, because I have some credentials in there, but I can add it without local_settings later.
